Rising stress, anxiety, and depression are common,
while traditional monitoring is often invasive,
stigmatizing, or slow to provide early support.
Mental Health Challenges
Traditional chat and social platforms can be
distracting and not inclusive for differently-abled
students.
Distraction in Communication
Academic collaboration is fragmented across tools,
causing inefficiency and limited engagement.
Fragmented Collaboration
Campus updates, events, and notices are scattered,
making it hard for students to stay informed.
Information Gaps
Modern campuses are not only centers for academic learning but also hubs of social interaction, collaboration, and
personal growth. However, students today face a range of challenges:

Handling sensitive information securely can be
challenging.
Ensuring informed consent and compliance with
privacy regulations.
Privacy and Ethical Concerns
Safeguarding messages, files, and media with end-
to-end encryption.
Preventing unauthorized access, data leaks, and
man-in-the-middle attacks.
Security Risks
Risk of false positives (flagging healthy behavior as
stress) or false negatives (missing real stress).
Variability in individual behavior and external factors
can reduce model reliability.
Accuracy of AI Predictions
Maintaining instant message delivery even during
peak usage or large group chats.
Optimizing encryption/decryption processes to
avoid delays.
Ensuring smooth performance across multiple
devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
Latency and Scalability

AI may misinterpret complex content or miss
key points, producing incomplete or misleading
summaries.
Notes may include images, tables, or mixed
media that AI struggles to summarize correctly.
AI Summarization Quality
Detecting and filtering inappropriate, offensive, or
spam content in real time.
Handling diverse content types (text, images, videos,
links) effectively.
Content Moderation 
Handling multiple users editing the same note
simultaneously without overwriting each other’s
changes.
Minimizing delays so that updates appear
instantly to all collaborators.
Concurrent Editing Conflicts
Ensuring event information, lost & found posts,
and announcements are posted and updated in
real time.
Maintaining reliability during high-traffic
periods or peak academic seasons.

Real-time sign-language-to-text, speech-to-text, and
text-to-speech require intensive computation.
But the system also needs to maintain low latency for
real-time chat and collaboration.

Event updates, collaboration edits, wellness
alerts, and chat messages all require timely
notifications.
But too many notifications increase stress,
contradicting the wellness objective.
 
Conflict:
Real-time AI translation →  increases server
workload and delays.
 High-speed performance →  limits AI translation
frequency or complexity.
Trade-Off:
Frequent notifications →  user awareness but
higher mental load.
Reduced notifications →  fewer updates and
missed events.
Trade-Off:
